# Neural Signal Processing for Emotion Identification

This repository contains code and documentation for a research project conducted by Pradeep Roy under the supervision of Prof. Konstantinos Michmizos.

## Project Overview
The project explores the use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for real-time analysis of EEG brainwave data to identify human emotions. The aim is to classify emotional states (positive, neutral, negative) using neural signal processing techniques.
